   Cloudkick Changelog Tool
------------------------------

A command line tool for noting when something was changed on a machine.  The
contents of the message are POST'ed to another server for logging.

Example Usage:
 $ ckl -m 'I reconfigured postfix'

Will post to your configured endpoint the following data:
  - API Key
  - Log Message
  - Machine Hostname
  - Username
  - Timestamp

Endpoints are just HTTP or HTTPS servers configured with an application
to store this data.  The API key is just a secret string that it is up to the
endpoint to validate.
